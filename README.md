**Gravity Assist is an open-universe physics space simulation game, built with C and [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).**

Gravity Assist is my attempt to build a fun, physics based game, while also exploring low-level technologies and concepts.

*Gravity Assist is currently under development, and performance is not guarenteed!*
