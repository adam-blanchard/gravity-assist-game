## TODO

- [ ] Update ship physics to factor in atmosphere drag. Ensure this is reflected in trajectories

- [ ] Finish mining capability
- [ ] Add exploration capability and track progress of explored bodies
- [ ] Space stations
- [ ] Add more planets, moons, and other star systems
- [ ] Ship Customisation
- [ ] KSP-style nav ball (nav circle for 2D)
- [ ] Death state
- [ ] Controls pop-out
- [ ] Planet type (volcanic, ice, gas etc.)
- [ ] Star types - standard, red dwarf, white dwarf, black hole, pulsar, etc.
- [ ] Function to load texture based on planet type - or, just render a specific texture - tbc
- [ ] Add ship health
- [ ] Add shooting
- [ ] Add enemy ships
- [ ] Add other descructables such as asteroids and space stations
- [ ] Add ship/player upgrades
- [ ] Add player statistics - money
- [ ] Add game saving
- [ ] Better HUD/GUI
- [ ] XP and skill trees - exploration, combat, trading
- [ ] Keep track of where the player has explored
- [ ] Ship upgrades - engines, fuel capacity, maneuverability, etc.
- [ ] Asteroid mining
- [ ] Universe map
- [ ] Smooth transition between camera lock
- [ ] Lock camera to celestial body when ship is landed

- [x] Render sun and planets
- [x] Render ship
- [x] Allow user to control the ship
- [x] All bodies affect eachother with gravity
- [x] Affect ship with gravity
- [x] Add flight path prediction lines
- [x] Camera lock
- [x] Time warp
- [x] Ship textures
- [x] Ship fuel
- [x] Heading GUI indicator
- [x] Speed GUI indicator
- [x] Ship relative speed to body
- [x] Initial collision detection and landing
- [x] Rudementary landing and take-off system
- [x] Fixed position on body when landed
- [x] Player starts landed on a planet
- [x] Body textures
- [x] Body types - universe, galaxy, star system, star, planet, moon, asteroid
- [x] QuadTree for scaling to thousands of bodies/systems or more
- [x] Moons
- [x] Home screen
- [x] Pause screen
- [x] Universe grid to show scale
- [x] Scale all masses, radius, and forces to be semi-realistic
- [x] Body rotation (need to rework the way bodies are rendered to set the rotation origin)
- [x] Refactor CelestialGrid to be fixed in game space instead of rendered on the screen
- [x] Add back relative speed indicator
- [x] Take-off/landing system
- [x] Add relative orbit instead of absolute - all bodies are flying through space so the orbit line of a ship around the planet is lost
- [x] Refactor stars, planets, and moons to use simple tree-based orbits
- [x] Only implement physics for player-controlled bodies
- [x] Implement whole-orbit visualisation for planets and moons - these will be easy to predict and stable
- [x] Implement trajectory prediction for player-controlled bodies 60 seconds into the future
- [x] Add atmospheres to planets
