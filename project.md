## Next Steps

1. [x] Finish orbit and size scaling - Objects are moving too fast now and we're getting weird interactions - scale the system down
2. [ ] Focus on player movement
3. [x] Add back textures
4. [ ] Add game mechanics

## TODO

- [ ] Take-off/landing system
- [ ] Space stations
- [ ] Add more planets, moons, and other star systems
- [ ] Ship Customisation
- [ ] KSP-style nav ball (nav circle for 2D)
- [ ] Death state
- [ ] Controls pop-out
- [ ] Planet type (volcanic, ice, gas etc.)
- [ ] Star types - standard, red dwarf, white dwarf, black hole, pulsar, etc.
- [ ] Function to load texture based on planet type - or, just render a specific texture - tbc
- [ ] Add ship health
- [ ] Add shooting
- [ ] Add enemy ships
- [ ] Add other descructables such as asteroids and space stations
- [ ] Add ship/player upgrades
- [ ] Add player statistics - money
- [ ] Add game saving
- [ ] Better HUD/GUI
- [ ] XP and skill trees - exploration, combat, trading
- [ ] Keep track of where the player has explored
- [ ] Ship upgrades - engines, fuel capacity, maneuverability, etc.
- [ ] Asteroid mining
- [ ] Universe map
